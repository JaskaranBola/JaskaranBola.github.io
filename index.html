      <br>You wake up in an empty room...
      <br>The room is illuminated by a single light bulb. Its freezing and dead silent. You can't remember why you were there; infact, you couldn't remember anything at all. This seems like the start of a horror movie, you should probably get out of here.Try
      <u>looking</u> around or maybe going towards a <u>direction</u> that could lead you to another room.
